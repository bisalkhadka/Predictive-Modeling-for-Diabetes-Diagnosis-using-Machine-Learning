Predictive Modeling for Diabetes Diagnosis using Machine Learning


This project explores the efficacy of machine learning models in diabetes prediction using Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. Multiple algorithms,including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes, were evaluated. SVM emerged as the top-performing algorithm, achieving 76 percent accuracy, followed by Random Forest with 75 percent accuracy and 76 percent recall. Insights gained highlight the relevance of selected features in distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. While the study provides valuable insights, addressing limitations and ethical considerations is crucial for realizing the full potential of machine learning in diabetes management. This research contributes to early detection and intervention in diabetes, with implications for improving patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.
